## Description
This project features a robust and efficient system for food image classification and information retrieval. The system utilizes the Food-5K and Food-101 datasets to identify food items from user-provided images.

The identification process is two-fold:

1. Food/Non-Food Classification: First, the system discerns whether the image represents "Food" or "Non-Food" based on a model trained on the Food-5K classification task.

2. Food Category Classification: If the image is classified as "Food", it further categorizes the item into one of the 101 specific food categories using a model developed for the Food-101 classification task.

This sequential approach allows for precise and accurate food item recognition from a diverse range of images.

Upon successful food item identification, the system provides a wealth of information to the users, offering an easy exploration into the culinary world. Users can access detailed information about the identified food item, including its name, recipe options, calorie count, and essential nutritional insights. Such detailed information promotes a deeper understanding of dietary choices and enables informed decision-making for healthier meal planning.

The system, built with a user-friendly interface, enables quick and easy identification of various food items along with access to valuable nutritional information, all based on the submitted images. With the integration of deep learning techniques, particularly models trained on the Food-5K and Food-101 datasets, the system assures high accuracy and reliability in food classification, enhancing its overall performance and user experience.
